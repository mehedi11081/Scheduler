# Scheduler
Scheduler is a class schedule android-based application. Class schedule application is the key to a well-managed, organized classroom. Class schedule permit students

to rapidly achieve everyday responsibilities that are obligatory of together the teacher and students. Here
also have a class cancel option for teacher if they want and they can confirm that the class has been canceled
by notifying each student of the course. Also have option for identify overlap class, add extra class option,
search empty class room. Finally, our project may be used as a model for the entire department. It describes
how admin, teachers and students understand the system and its functionality. However, it supports any
designer and developer to contribution in software development lifecycle (SDLC) processes. Now I am using
the agile model to complete my project.

In that project we are developing an android-based application to provide up-to-date daily class time,
identify overlap class, add extra class option, search empty class room information to the user’s needs and
user will collect information.

For example, A user must need’s an account to login in this app, but he/she doesn’t have any account than
he/she needs to sign up. Then the home page will be shown. In home page there will be multiple types of
category. He/she can also select the category and can also collect these information.
